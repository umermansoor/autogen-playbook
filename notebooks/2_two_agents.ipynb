      "\n",
      "1. **Check Your Connections:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that all cables (Ethernet, power) are securely connected.\n",
      "   - If you're using Wi-Fi, check if your device is connected to the correct network.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Restart Your Devices:**\n",
      "   - Restart your modem and router. Unplug them from the power source, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug them back in.\n",
      "   - Restart your computer or device as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for Outages:**\n",
      "   - Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to see if there are any outages or maintenance activities in your area.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Device Settings:**\n",
      "   - For Wi-Fi, make sure that the Wi-Fi is turned on and that Airplane Mode (if applicable) is turned off.\n",
      "   - If you're using Ethernet, ensure that your computer's network adapter is enabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Network Troubleshooter:**\n",
      "   - If you're using Windows, try running the built-in Network Troubleshooter. You can find this by going to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Troubleshoot problems.\n",
      "   - For macOS, you can use the Wireless Diagnostics tool. Hold down the Option key and click the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar, then select \"Open Wireless Diagnostics\".\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **IP Address:**\n",
      "   - Renew your IP address. On Windows, open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig /release` followed by `ipconfig /renew`.\n",
      "   - On macOS, go to System Preferences > Network, select your network connection, click Advanced, and then click the TCP/IP tab. Click the Renew DHCP Lease button.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Check for Outages:**\n",
      "   - Have you had a chance to contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to check if there are any known outages or maintenance in your area?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Wi-Fi Network:**\n",
      "   - If you are using Wi-Fi, make sure you are connected to the correct network. You might want to try disconnecting from your Wi-Fi and reconnecting or even entering your Wi-Fi password again.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Network Troubleshooting Tools:**\n",
      "   - For Windows:\n",
      "     - Open the Start Menu, type \"troubleshoot settings,\" and select it.\n",
      "     - Under ‘Network & Internet,’ click on \"Internet Connections\" and then click \"Run the troubleshooter.\"\n",
      "   - For macOS:\n",
      "     - Hold down the Option key and click the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar, then select \"Open Wireless Diagnostics\" and follow the prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Check Network Adapter Settings:**\n",
      "   - For Windows:\n",
      "     - Open Control Panel, go to \"Network and Sharing Center,\" then click on \"Change adapter settings.\"\n",
      "     - Right-click on your network adapter and select \"Properties.\"\n",
      "     - Ensure that \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" is checked and click on it, then click \"Properties.\"\n",
      "     - Ensure \"Obtain an IP address automatically\" and \"Obtain DNS server address automatically\" are selected.\n",
      "   - For macOS:\n",
      "     - Open System Preferences, go to \"Network,\" select your network connection, and click \"Advanced.\"\n",
      "     - Under the TCP/IP tab, make sure \"Configure IPv4\" is set to \"Using DHCP.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reset Network Settings:**\n",
      "   - For Windows:\n",
      "     - Open the Command Prompt as an administrator and type the following commands, pressing Enter after each one:\n",
      "       ```bash\n",
      "       netsh winsock reset\n",
      "       netsh int ip reset\n",
      "       ipconfig /release\n",
      "       ipconfig /renew\n",
      "       ipconfig /flushdns\n",
      "       ```\n",
      "   - For macOS:\n",
      "     - Go to System Preferences > Network, select your network connection on the left, and click the \"-\" button to remove it.\n",
      "     - Click the \"+\" button to add it back again and reconfigure your settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Try Another Device:**\n",
      "   - Check if other devices in your home can connect to the internet. This can help determine if the issue is with your device or the network itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you please try these steps and let me know if anything changes?\n",
